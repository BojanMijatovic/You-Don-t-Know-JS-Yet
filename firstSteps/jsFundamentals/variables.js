  1. Create four variables that contain numbers. Call the variables something sensible.
  2. Add the first two variables together and store the result in another variable.
  3.  Subtract the fourth variable from the third and store the result in another variable.
   4. Multiply the results from the last two steps together, storing the result in a variable called finalResult. The product 5. should be 48. If it isn't, you'll have to adjust some of the initial input values.
     6. Finally, write a calculation that checks whether finalResult is an even number. Store the result in a variable called evenOddResult.
